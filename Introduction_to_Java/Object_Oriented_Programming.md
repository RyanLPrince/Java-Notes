# Object Oriented Programming

## Two Programming Paradigms
* All computer programs consist of two elements: **code** and **data**.

### Procedure-oriented (process-oriented) Programming
* Programs are organized around its code and *what is happening*.
* As a series of linear steps.
* *code acting on data*.

> Procedure-oriented programming is a programming paradigm where programs are organized around their code and *what is happening* as a series of linear steps.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Programs organized around its data (Objects) and *who is being affected*.
* *data controlling access to code*.
* Data and code (functionality) are combined and are wrapped inside something called an object.
* An object is a data structure that consists of states (fields) and behaviours (Methods).
* Objects are models of the real world environment.
* OOP is a way of programming that is based on the interactions of these objects.
* We define the data types (objects) and the operations that can be applied to these types.


> Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm where programs are organized around Objects (data) and *what is being affected* through a set of well-defined interfaces. 

#### Class
* A class is a template of an object.
* Describes the fields and methods an object of its type supports.


## Four Key Principles of Java

1) Inheritance 
* The process by which one class acquires methods and fields from another. 
  * A Poodle class can inherit attributes from a Dog class.  
2) Polymorphism
* A feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions (ability of an Object to take different forms).
3) Abstraction
* Focus on higher levels of programming (functionality) rather than details of parts (implementation).
4) Encapsulation
* Wrapping fields and methods in single well defined units.
* Controlling access to the units.
