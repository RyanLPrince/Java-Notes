# A Brief History of Java

## The Birth of Modern Programing: C

* The C programming language was born out of the need for a structured, efficient, high-level language, that could replace assembly code when creating system programs.
* Prior to C, programmers had to chose between programs that optimized a certain set of traits or another e.g.
  
  **Assembly Code** - Efficient but difficult to learn. <br><br>
  **FORTRAN** - Efficient for scientific applications but not extensible for use in system programs. <br><br>
  **BASIC** - Easy to learn but not very powerful (very basic indeed). <br><br>
  **PASCAL** - Structured but rigid. <br><br>
  
 > Another compounding problem was that computer languages, such as BASIC, COBOL, and FORTRAN were not designed around structured principles. Instead, they relied upon GOTO as the primary means of program control, whereby a GOTO statement would perform a one-way transfer of control to another line of code. A consquence of writing programs in these languages, was to produce 'spaghetti code'- a mass of tangled jumps and conditional branches that make a program virtually impossible to follow. In contrast, C divides a problem into smaller modules called functions or procedures, each of which handles a particular responsibility. These functions return control after its responsibility has been fulfilled.

* C reconcilled conflicting attributes that dogged early programming languages.
* Unlike the programming languages that came before it, that were created as an academic or bureaucratic excercise, C was designed, implemented, and developed by real, working programmers, reflecting the way that they approached the job of programming.
* From its inception in the early 1970s through to the 1980s, C became the dominant computer language and its creation is considered by many to have marked the beginning of the modern age of computer programming.

## The Next Step: C++

* By the early 1980s, many projects were pushing the structured approach championed by C to the limits of complexity that could be managed.
* As a procedure-oriented programming language, C is characterized by programs that are conceptually organized around its code - what is happening, as a series of linear steps. 
* A new programming paradigm was invented called object-oriented programming (OOP), to push the boundaries of complexity.
* OOP is a programming paradigm which helps organize complex programs through the use of the principles of inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, programs are organized around its data - who is being affected, as a set of well-defined interfaces.
* C++ (originally originally called 'C with classes' which alludes to some of the features encorporated) was built on the foundations of C, including many of the features and benefits - a key reason for its success - while also extending C with OOP aspects.
