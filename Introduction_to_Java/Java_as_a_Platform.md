# Java as a Platform


* Java is a platform because it is a piece of software that excecutes a program. 
* Java has 3 main software components: Java Development Kit (JDK), Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM), each with a specific configuation for a target operating system.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

* Software development environment which is used to develop and run Java applications.
* Contains JRE & development tools needed to develop a program in Java.
* JDK contains a private JVM and other resources to complete the development of a java Application:
  - Compiler (javac).
    - Transforms Java source code into bytecode (that can then be run on any machine that implements the JVM).
  - Interpreter (java).
    - Executes compiled Java bytecode   
  - Archiver (jar).
    - JAR (Java ARchive) packaging (aggregating) Java class files and associated metadata  
  - Document generator (javadoc).
